# External Code Editor Addon

=====================================

## Overview

**External Code Editor** is an addon designed for [Anki version 2.1](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), offering advanced code editing and updating capabilities during card reviews. With this addon, you can seamlessly copy code from your review session to an HTML file, edit the HTML file using an external editor (such as VSCode), and run the code within the review just like a browser. This addon streamlines the process of updating code directly within the notetype, making it particularly valuable for add-on development or creating intricate card templates.

## Features

### Code Copy and Update

-   **Copy Code (Ctrl+C):** Create an HTML file in the `collection.media` directory, copying the code from the current notetype to the HTML file.

-   **Edit HTML File:** Edit the HTML file in an external editor (e.g., VSCode) to refine your code.

-   **Update Code (Ctrl+S):** Transfer the updated code from the HTML file back to the notetype in the review, then reload the current card.

### Requirements

-   Compatible with Anki version 2.1.20 or higher.

## Usage

1. **Menubar Integration:** Adds **Copy Code** and **Update Code** options to the menubar in the Review State, enhancing your editing experience.
